When we had a employee consultation I saw some letters from the tax office on his desk and when I asked him about it he tore me down. So I told it Maria. She was thinking about doing some investigations on her own. Because the possibility of corruption was high. With Patricks lifestyle, the big cars and everything… Maria and I didn’t have much contact ever since. She said the risk is to high that someone draws their own conclusions… But it seams like Patrick came to a conclusion. And he may even knows that it was me who informed Maria.

scene_investigation:
  - base_1: "Ok, so we are standing in the zombie themed area of the ghost ride. In some way it’s a quite romantic area... we earlier shared a seat at the bench with two zombies holding hand. In the background there is a scary tree, with no leaf. We can look at the train cabin, under the bench and behind the tree. I think we should search in order to find some hints about the murderer. Where should we start?"
  - base_2: "Let´s have another close look at everything..."
  - base_3: "This is all we can find here. We can now talk about my co-workers. I get the feeling that they have something to do with it..."
  - weapon: "Let me see... the weapon is a knife. It’s a bit bloody and it’s a bit scary to hold it. Should I take a closer look or should we put it back where we found it?"
  - knife: "The Knife... Oh there are initials in it. It says “A.P”  in the knife. Hm, who might it be?"
  - body: "Ok, this feels a bit scary to look at a dead body, but it’s the best thing we can do. Let’s move a few steps closer... Hmm, I think I know the dead woman in the cabin."
  - cabin: "It has two seats, as ours did. On the seat closer to us and closer to the themed area is the female corpse. She is covered in blood and a note is pinned to her chest. I don’t see why and how she died... Should I investigate it more or should I tell you about the note..."
  - bench: "Just some zombie love dripping through the wooden slats of the bench. Or is this something else... Lets stand up but be careful to not get tangled in the zombies limbs."
  - tree: "The tree is a bit scary. It’s a dead tree with no leafs. Behind the tree there is just some light equipment to give the scene a spoky feeling."
  - note: "There is a Note on the body. It says “Your are next”. I believe it means that I am the target the murderer intends to go after next."
