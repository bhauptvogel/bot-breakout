"interesting premise, good dialogue ",after solving the first puzzle and talking about all the coworkers i didnt know what to do next,
I loved your game!,I was not sure how to progress to the police,I spent a lot of time on the 3 digit code
really creative story. mika responds great to my input,the story felt a bit unstructured or i was really bad at navigating it :),
,,
Storyline is good.,"Confusing text, misleading. Bot is not leading to the right direction. Solution of the riddle is not clear. 686 -7 + 2 / 2 should be 340 or 341 but it was not the correct pin.",Reduce the usage of text. Often boring when too much too read.
Great texts and story. ,,I got confused with the tasks and don't know if I did them correctly. Furthermore I would rather not have known anything about the story before playing the game completely
I think the story is really creative,The navigation inside the game was sometimes confusing. I didn't know directly how to end the game,"All the clues I found led to Anna. But she wasn't the killer. In retrospect, I think it was Patrick. ðŸ”ª"
game play at start is good ,as game proceeds further it became boring and difficult to understand the gameplay,
"Richtig cool, dass man eine Zusammenfassung bekommt welche Informationen man gesammelt hat! Das habe ich bis jetzt noch nirgends gesehen. AuÃŸerdem sind die Hilfestellungen sehr nÃ¼tzlich und passend.",Ich habe wÃ¤hrend des Spiels immer mal die Orientierung verloren. Die Story ist etwas dÃ¼rftig und das Ende ist ziemlich vorhersehbar.,
"very interesting and creative story, I can imagine the place",,
a very creative idea ,there might be a math mistake in the first task (train number) ,
,,
the storyline is interesgting and amkes the user want to play more,the background image can be improved. the explanation after each answer is too much lengthy. ,-
