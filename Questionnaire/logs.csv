Maybe I could have prevented this whole situation and even Maria's death… So let me tell you the story: Patrick is not really a kind person but he is a good boss. When we had an employee consultation I saw some letters from the tax office on his desk and when I asked him about it he tore me down. So I told Maria. She was thinking about doing some investigations on her own. Because the possibility of corruption was high. With Patrick's lifestyle, the big cars and everything… Maria and I didn’t have much contact ever since. She said the risk is too high that someone draws their own conclusions… But it seems like Patrick came to a conclusion. And he may even know that it was me who informed Maria.

Maybe I could have prevented this whole situation and even Maria's death… So let me tell you the story: Patrick is not really a kind person but he is a good boss. When we had an employee consultation I saw some letters from the tax office on his desk and when I asked him about it he tore me down. So I told Maria. She was thinking about doing some investigations on her own. Because the possibility of corruption was high. With Patrick's lifestyle, the big cars and everything… Maria and I didn’t have much contact ever since. She said the risk is too high that someone draws their own conclusions… But it seems like Patrick came to a conclusion. And he may even know that it was me who informed Maria. That could be the reason for the note. He wants to get me. And now we are here… with a dead journalist and a dirty business secret

2023-06-13T13:49:23.505082,6d53b100-0d6a-46d4-8921-227cfa652065,And who is Kira?,Kira is my co-worker. We are pretty good... I helped her to get through the breakup with Maria. That really took her down she was super upset - especially because of Maria's new boyfriend Victor.

Maybe I could have prevented this whole situation and even Maria's death… So let me tell you the story: Patrick is not really a kind person but he is a good boss. When we had an employee consultation I saw some letters from the tax office on his desk and when I asked him about it he tore me down. So I told Maria. She was thinking about doing some investigations on her own. Because the possibility of corruption was high. With Patrick's lifestyle, the big cars and everything… Maria and I didn’t have much contact ever since. She said the risk is too high that someone draws their own conclusions… But it seems like Patrick came to a conclusion. And he may even know that it was me who informed Maria. That could be the reason for the note. He wants to get me. And now we are here… with a dead journalist and a dirty business secret"

Maybe I could have prevented this whole situation and even Maria's death… So let me tell you the story: Patrick is not really a kind person but he is a good boss. When we had an employee consultation I saw some letters from the tax office on his desk and when I asked him about it he tore me down. So I told Maria. She was thinking about doing some investigations on her own. Because the possibility of corruption was high. With Patrick's lifestyle, the big cars and everything… Maria and I didn’t have much contact ever since. She said the risk is too high that someone draws their own conclusions… But it seems like Patrick came to a conclusion. And he may even know that it was me who informed Maria. That could be the reason for the note. He wants to get me. And now we are here… with a dead journalist and a dirty business secret"

Maybe I could have prevented this whole situation and even Maria's death… So let me tell you the story: Patrick is not really a kind person but he is a good boss. When we had an employee consultation I saw some letters from the tax office on his desk and when I asked him about it he tore me down. So I told Maria. She was thinking about doing some investigations on her own. Because the possibility of corruption was high. With Patrick's lifestyle, the big cars and everything… Maria and I didn’t have much contact ever since. She said the risk is too high that someone draws their own conclusions… But it seems like Patrick came to a conclusion. And he may even know that it was me who informed Maria. That could be the reason for the note. He wants to get me. And now we are here… with a dead journalist and a dirty business secret"
