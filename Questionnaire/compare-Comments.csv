Nice background picture,"I don't know what to combine the rope with and I can't simply say ""look around"" or ""what's around me"" to get an idea of what I could pick up.",
Very nice chatbot implementation - it seems very advanced in terms of game mechanics.,"A few things - you can't answer a numeric question with ""one"" but only with ""1"". Otherwise the bot would answer something completely different which leads to confusion. Also, for my taste, the riddles are a bit too hard (i.e. lock combinations).",
Nice game idea,"Basic interaction with the game feels unintuitive. ""Looking around"" in the room at the beginning leads to losing the game, you have to ""search it"". The introductory message talks about asking inmates and you're not sure whether that makes sense but you can't ask inmates. Suddenly you're in the laundry - it's not really realistic to find a note with 5 riddles in the bin, but that's ok. Entity matching doesn't work smoothly - you sometimes have to type the full item names (i.e. dirty [...] basked instead of just basket). By improving these thinks, I think you can make a cool game.",
I like that the game is complete.,"The riddles are too simple, and expects a simple answer. Some elements are case sensitive such as ""rope"". I can only provide a simple predefined prompts, NLU is not utilized, as much. ",
The story is captivating.,"It is not clear, how the player should provide the sequence to the lady in the canteen. The response of the game is ""What is g?"" It doesn't make sense. Although the name is extracted successfully, the game still says ""Nobody"". The game says I can examine the food trays but I am unable to do so. ",
,,
I am glad to have finished the game,There are some grammatical errors,In the last challenge I escaped the room by predicting that we had to use a key. So I didn't get to see what the third puzzle actually was.
I like the story a lot !,The game ended unexpectedly after typing something :(,Sometimes I forgot what was around so I had to scroll up many times
I like the navigation system of the game!,The first text was in my opinion quite long which made me feel a bit overwhelmed.,I think I got the right numbers to unlock the kitchen locker but I didn't get the sequence right.
I really like the game design with the prison optic. You have the impression to write with a  jail inmate instead of a robot. Also the story and writing style is great in general. really nice descriptions of the enviornment so you get a visual image of where you are,"It isn't always clear what you have to do next and you have to be super careful how you write your phrases which makes it difficult to play, because you don't really know what kind of answer the chatbot wants",not really
"The riddles are nice and not too simple, but still doable. ",The game doesn't always recognize the words or names,no
The idea is nice. The plot twists keep it entertaining,It has some spelling mistakes...And it's really confusing. I have the impression if getting random answers and game overs ,"It's really fun, but also confusing."
"I liked the game, it was fun :D",I don't know if I just got the end wrong but it didn't get my name and always said that there is nothing like my name in the room ,
,I was very confused at some points and didn't manage to finish the game in time ,Maybe more hints would be helpful 
I really like the idea,I was a bit lost at some point - I couldn't figure out the Mensa-lady riddle ,"Maybe some more hints. At some point the game started again and called me ""chilli"" while I was trying to solve the Mensa-lady riddle "
"The recognition of the text that you give the bot works very well -> i havent had any problems with the bot not recognizing my input, which made the playing experience very smooth and generaly enjoyable ","I wasnt able to finish tthe game properly -> I got stuck in the basement where you had to solve the riddles
Although I enjoyed the riddles themselves, having to think for a brief moment so sovle them. I couldnt figure out the sentence the game wanted in order to get the key. If I havent overread an obvious hint, I would suggest giving the user an orientation of what the sentence should be like, since there are so many options to form a sentence with the three words from the riddles. Having to guess sentence after sentence and still not figuring out the correct one becomes frustrating very quickly",
"the texts of the game are very well written and allowed for great immersion and imagination of the world you wanted to create. this made playing the game much more enjoyable and fun. 
Also I found the playing experience much more entertaining because of this, despite the story and setting itself being quite basic. ","it often wasnt that clear what the input should be to advance in the game. E.g i didnt know how to get into the library -> the text you get by cracking the locker was again imaginative and well written put i had no clue what to do next
same with the canteen riddle-> solving the riddle wasnt the problem but i wasnt able to put the answer i thought was correct into an correct input for the bot to undersand or generally had no idea how to communicate with the bot accordingly in that scenario",
i like the story of your game. i thinks its quite creative and also the text outputs of the bot add to the immersion of the game which enhances the playing experince and makes the setting enjoyable. ,sometimes its kinda hard to come up with the correct input that the bot needs in order to progress in the game or its not quite clear how to interact with the bot to progress. In some cases it was just lacking nlu data or stories but other times it was unclear what to do. E.g in the second room figuring out how to open the door prooved to be quite difficult due to not being clear how to interact with ELIAS,
,,"I think the structure of the puzzles is a bit too straight forward and the next steps were too easy/clear, maybe you could add some ""dead ends"". Anyway, a nice little escape game :)
Most of my inputs were recognized very well but full sentence like ""use the rope for the mountains"" were not recognized (I had to write ""use rope mountain"")."
I really enjoyed to solve the puzzles in the first room.,"Unfortunately I couldn't complete the game as I was stuck to solve the second room. I coudn't ask fo help or a hint. And my inputs were no longer recognized in a helpfulw way , so it got stuck in loops were only the welcome message was shown or I got no output. After 20 minutes I quit the game.",
Inputs were recognized well. Story was not affected by misunderstandings.,,Maybe the story could be a little embellished.
,game is not fun and creative. Just simple riddles with no context,
,,
The communication between the bot and the player is very intuitive and logical,"In my opinion, there are not enough puzzles/rooms and the puzzles present are way too simple","When you try to open the lock on the bridge in the last room using the command ""combine key with lock"" it doesnt seem to work. The expected input is ""combine key with bridge"". Maybe allow the first command to work as well, since it is more intuitive imo"
"I liked most puzzles in the game. The ones with the ""blood"" and ""red sea"" as their answers are a bit too easy imo",At times it was not very intuitive what to do next,
Well.... There where questions?,"Please for the love of god, do riddles that are possible to solve with the informations available inside the chatbot.
Tell a Story as well. Like what was this? I am in a room with a lock? Where, why, how do i feel? Nothing.

This chatbot should tell a story. Be a challenge, be creative or anything else. this was .... nothing of it. It looks like you coded 2h and called it a day.

Please make it better for the next time. Seriously.",I hope this was only the Prototype and your real bot is something else :)
"I like the setting a lot and the storyline.
It feels a little bit more like a Escape Room, then other Chatbots.

good atmosphere ","No support System when struggling with tasks(hints)

Not broad enough awnsers are possible for the same interaction (Unscrew the Screw, open the toilet with the screwdriver, use screwdriver etc)

Some texts are perfect, some need more emotions... maybe work with what you hear from the person and make it interchangeable:
example:
random_select_panting = randint(0, len(select_panting)-1)
return_string = f""{select_panting[random_select_panting]} you hear his steps on a concret floor as he goes to {item} [the answer]""

nudge people more, to write the sentences that you prepared for.

Overall though, it was a good Chatbot, i think next time around you have something to be proud of. :)","Overall good ideas. Unfortunately not implemented perfectly just now, but it shows hints of greatness! Would be a perfect 2d game "
"Nice Story, with well written Drama, although it got lifted when getting hints

Good that you implemented hints","To narrow intents ""open the locker"" didn't work for looking into it for example

Hints came too early and you are locked into awnsering the bot if you want to search for clues first again(if you think you missed something)

Other then that, you need to implement more rooms :)
That was more like 3 min",Nothing
,"Bot didn't understand the answer for first puzzle until it was written in a certain format  , add more examples . 
Also the game it too linear and too short . Direct questions and direct answers I didn't really get to experience the story ",
,,
,,
,,
"Good to play, task and interacting is very clear","""pick up item"" doesnt work but ""take the item"" does",Very easy and short in general
,"After i wasnt able to answer the first riddle i typed ""look around"" and the chatbot said i loose because other inmates heard of my plan. I could still play the game and i just typed ""ok"" which somehow brought me to the point that i woke up in the nurses room and had to solve the next riddle. After i solved the riddle, the bot said i could look at the map by just typing ""map"" and when i did that, it told me that i couldnt look at the map. That was the point where i stopped playing. ","Shouldnt be the five digit code: 4 8 15 16 11?
1. Square root  of 16: 4
2. Sum 3 and 5: 8
3. One less then 4th: 15
4. Twice the second: 16 
5. Difference 3rd 1st: 11
Maybe im stupid but i really tried out a lot and nothing worked. "

"idea is nice, maybe more discription of the place",I dont know how to use hints. i got lost in the first level,"fix the hint function with valuable hints, would help the user so you dont get lost"
nice story,it was not clear how to use elias,"maybe add ""Elias use door"" to elias message to make it more clear"
"first room is very good, nice riddle, an interesing things to find","the kitchen is very confusing, I didnt know what to do and how to find the key or the 3 digits for the locker",give a clear advise for the kitchen and maybe do a help or hint function
The Picture is funny and 69 :D,Not every one likes fotball and there is nothing to do as only to answer question. It didnt fell like a escape room because there was nothing to expolre.,
,,
,,
"clearly structured, puzzles are easy to understand, setting works well in my imaginaiton, but could be used more effectively (for story and locations)","the text messages output by the game could be of better quality, they are a bit convoluted sometimes.
also the input recognition could be better (for example i tried to answer a question with ""option one"" which did not work)",
"first puzzle works, tied nicely into the setting
the setting itself works nicely aswell","Name recognition did not work with standard american name.

I did not know what kind of sentence to form in the second puzzle and it was unclear if i had the wrong answer or if the game just did not recognise it. Other commands hadnt worked befor because of mistake in capitalization or other little variations to the answer, so i could not be sure.

The game also sometimes throws the opening dialogue and name question.",
,,
,it was not clear for me if the game was over or not,
"I really liked the different options at the library, crack a locker or persuade the guy","I couldn't get past the canteen riddle, it is not intuitive to know what to enter, also I wanted to get back to the hallway but I had to enter ""pull door"" for it every time, even though I was not in the Audimax anymore, takes you out of the game
I also couldn't for the life of me figure out how to crack a locker
I was confused as to why the tutor is in the seminar room if the story says he is at the canteen",
Easy game flow,No,
,,
Great and creative theme,"no clear instructions from the start, maybe let the AI pick up words instead of while sentences.
for example: instead of me typing ""pick up vessel"" maybe pick up or vessel should also work",
I like your story idea and your design choices,I couldn't get past the first riddle and the bot didn't provide any hints or help,
"really entertaining characters & creative puzzles! I especially liked how you planted clues & the world builing. generally, the bot responds well to my input",a few hints about the input structure at the mensa puzzle would be great^^ sometimes very specific input is needed to genereate the anticipated (or any) response from the bot & at times i wasn't entirely sure what the overlying task is so I basically just explored the rooms,the link to the game from your google doc didn't work for me
Perfect background picture,Help is not as Helpful,Amazing job d(-_^)
Wayyyy too complex,Wayyyy too complex,(*TｰT)b amazing work
Cool background photo,A more in detail HELP is nice,d(⌒ー⌒)

Language is easy to understand. Not very difficult.,"Yes, I couldn't find third tool at all. Three objects in the forest like caves, trees and rocks. I was able to find and pickup rope and torch and after that I lost the game track there. I was not able to figure out even after playing and searching for 15-20 min to enter the next level. I couldn't combine items and I couldn't find third tool also. I tried to look and check everything, but it didn't help. It's not clear what to look for third tool.",Clear instructions like what to look and what to follow next.
Game is definitely creative. Structure is good.,"I couldn't follow the game after some time. May be the game was end or some instructions was not clear. I lost the game after here ""The door does not open; it is controlled via the ship's central control system."". I don't know how to move forward from here.",Game has lot of written text. It can be reduced little bit.
,"- at the beginning in your text you state ""ancient roman rock"" when trying to pick up the ancient roman rock, it is not possible. Only when writing ""pick up rock""
- The final riddle did not accept my name as the input
- too many spelling mistakes ",some of the riddles didn't feel like they were self-developed and just copied from the internet
"I really like the underlying idea of the escape game with multiple rooms and kill-actions, that you have to restart the game. It reminds me a bit of the movie edge of tomorrow","The game sadly just does not work yet. 
""I wake up in the prison cell"" -> take a look around ""you are in the laundry room"" is confusing as I did not change the room to the initial message.
When trying to solve the code provided in the laundry room: 
> Clue 2: ""The second digit is the sum of 3 and 5.""  -> 8
> Clue 4: ""The fourth digit is twice the second digit."" would be 16, which is not a digit but two. Numbers 3-5 become two digit numbers which does not work for a 5 digit code which is asked for afterwards. 
Assuming that clue 4 refers to the number 2 instead of the solution of clue 2, I got a 5 digit code, which the NLU did not recognize and only gave the response to give a 5 digit code.

Because of that I couldn't further play the game and evaluate the other stages",Some spelling mistakes need to be fixed
The story line is interesting and creates excitement.,Make sure the game follows the story path and more understanable wha t to do in next step.,no
The theme is very good,"The game, is not going forward, after it describes the contents of an item, it is unclear for me, what to respond with. If I say oh, it is asking me my name again.",
THe story line feels interesting,"I could't, go forward in the game. The bot wasn't taking my answer even though my answer was correct.  ",
The Inventory feature worked well and was nice to have.,Hint option for the riddles couldn't be triggered. Wasn't able to solve last riddle.,
"creative discribtions, nice texts","I never really know what to do, shorter and clearer tasks would be nice",The riddles are way to hard! if you want to keep them make sure to give an example of the input you want
I enjoyed reading the texts very much. They help to put yourself in the game.,"Well, it is just a demo. But in the current state it is quite short.","I discovered some bugs/ sentences that doesn't work:

'Put on the working boots' / 'Take the working boots' (I don't know if you are supposed to take them)

'Go to the control panels'

'Go to the next room' answers with: 'Unfortunately, I couldn't understand what to open.'

.......

I liked the story/feeling of the game so far :)"
"The story and the game prompts are very interesting and captivating. I like how I am able to say look around, and it always says what is relevant for that particular situation.","Once, I get into the kitchen, things are a lot difficult to understand, I am able to pick up multiple spices into the inventory. I am unable to check inventory. ","Maybe reduce some complexity, or provide some hints. "
The flow and the story line look pretty interesting.,"But without knowing what items to look around and what to pickup, user can't pickup anything. You have to be specific about at least what items are present in the surroundings.",
Great texts and information provided,,
The story and the script is catchy and interesting.,Users will get stuck at the start of the game itself because the prompts shown are not very clear with the next action to be done. ,
,,better sorting of prompts could be implemented to improve user experience
The game is very well structured and easy to learn,"There were different levels, but the riddles were not really more difficult at level 3 than at level 1. Maybe the riddle structure can be changed a bit to challenge the players a bit more.",
,,
,I feel bored and it's not much fun,
,,
,,
,,
I like that you implemented an inventory and I also like the Riddles even thought I could not solve them. I also like that it's possible to combine things you found during the game,The hints do not work and also my name is not recognised. Also the grammar is sometimes a bit confusing. Maybe use Deepl or some other program to check the text. I think sometimes my answers to the riddles were interpreted as some other command so that the bot restarted. ,I think your game idea is overall good and I'm looking forward to trying the next version where I can hopefully solve the escape room ;)
"I like and enjoy the idea of the game, I had fun testing it as far as I got. 
Sadly I wasnt able to crack one riddle and therefore did not complete the escape.",,"I was not able to finish the game as I did not crack the code for the looker in the kitchen. Some Help / Hint function would be good in case the player gets stuck.

- The NLU could be improved, eg.: ""look at notebook"" doesnt work, only ""look at notepad"" works
- After I entered the kitchen I didnt manage to get back the room before (""leave room "" or something like that) to try to go through another door.

- When I pick up the spices, it would be cool if they are not listed in the shelf anymore. Also after spicing the sauce, if I look at the oven (look at sauce did not work) still states that it need spicing. "
,,
I really like the descriptions provided for the different characters and also for the building itself. I also like your small riddles in between,"I think there is a bug in the pasta riddle or I didn't get how I should answer to this. Also I could not get a hint for solving it, which would have been nice since I didn't manage to finish the escape room at all because I could solve that riddle. At least I guess that this would have helped me get to the next stage. The bot only answered with ""What is c?"" or some other letter depending on my input. ",I know it's not really possible to shorten the text but maybe a newline inside one speech bubble would be possible so that the bot answer is a bit more structured. Also I think it would be nice not to write multiple single speech bubbles for describing a room but instead only use one and use newline if that's possible. (I'm not sure about that myself...) 
Game is so creative ,"unfortunately i cannot complete the game , because of toughness in communication ",
,,
,,
Game is creative apart from difficulty in playing,,
"I enjoyed the writeups about character and situations , though felt someplaces it was a bit too long giving a lot of mental load on player","Could not progress with game due to how to combine digits to form a key are not mentioned, And how to start from each place is a bit confusing",It would be good if user is suggested what to do next
The feature of Reducing lives left for wrong answers is really great.,"The instructions for the user input format is not clear, could not understand how to give an answer in a structure expected by a nlu.",I think nlu should be trained with more user friendly intents.
The idea of prison break with multiple props and rooms to explore with few leading to nothing looks good,Bit confusing what to do next,For puzzle answers when answer is provided bot says Game over and then proceeds with the game
Game is so interesting and simple ,,
The story line is very interesting.,Couldn't get any response other than Game Introduction.,There is only one response(Intro) coming for every command.
I like your story and the clear instructions on how to navigate the escape game. I also like the riddle with the herbs,The Hint/Help command doesn't work and sometimes the story flow is a bit halting and not so natural. Also I couldn't inspect the Laundry room even tough this was proposed to me by the bot. At that point I didn't know how to continue.,"I would have found it more intuitive to use ""Look around"" instead of ""Search ..."" but this is just a personal preference. For me ""Search"" implies that I'm searching for something specific"
I'm sorry i have not...,"The game was over before the first riddle. I think I found the right date (31.12.) but it was not at all clear in which format it should be entered. I tried a little bit and then my lives were already gone. 

Also, the setting you were thrown into wasn't well explained and completely out of context.",
Nices Setting!,"ich bin im zweiten Raum nicht mehr weiter gekommen, da wären mehr Hilfestellungen nötig.",Es hat wirklich Bock gemacht :D 
,"when the game begins, it does not guide you through the steps and you are so confused. I tried several different commands but I could not get any answer. It was so confusing and the player has no choice and hint .The help option is not helping at all. ",
,,
,"- the bot does not recognize most names
- the bot does not recognize most date forms (1st of january etc)",
,,
"I really like your idea and how you lead the player into the game. I also think it's good that you tell the player what kind of actions he/she can take. Generally I like that the answers of your bot aren't too long, so that as a player you do not feel overwhelmed by the text.","I think in the first sentence of the Intro message a word is missing. ""You slowly open your eyes and look around the room you found yourself in."" (in where?) 
Also a help/hint functionality would be nice. At one point I didn't know how to continue and some of my messages even triggered one of the first message again, which was confusing.",
,,
the story has the potential to be appealing,"the beginning paragraph ends with a question: what should you do? but there is no clue to guide the user. and the bot doesn't understand the help request, or any suggestion from the user to start the game. in the middle of the game, the beginning paragraph appeared again and it had two more lines. it was really confusing. the puzzle seems to be wrong. I got the message ""Game over"" right before the puzzle, so it makes no sense if the game is over why it provides a new puzzle??? Also, I think the game can be more friendly and provides a situation where the user believes that is talking to a person.",
,,
the game was good ,the ending was not clear,
,game is little boring and bit difficult to solve riddles the hints can be provided,
the same concept was good,needed little more clarity,
Game is overall good. ,Game is nice but in the end when I tried to reaarange my name and escape i was not able to do so.,
,,
,,
Game theme is really innovative.,Unable to play the game from start.,
Nice theme ,,
,,
The Harry potter theme is well implemented and enjoyable to play,"the riddle in the basement cant be solved. as far as I can tell the words are night,  castle and witch but the game does not accept my answer so I unfortunately cant play it further. I also tried to make a sentence with these words but that didnt work either.",
i think the idea is good,"in its current state the game is unplayable. Randomly dying, multiple disjointed response messages, just saying look around in the beginning causes death, solving the first riddle somehow kills you and also unlocks the map at the same time. Not really playable",
the answer for help is good ,I was stuck with the creative sentence (night castle witch) ,
really seemed well thought out and well made,I couldn't figure out how to properly enter the solution to the lunch lady puzzle. I think I solved the riddle but I couldnt figure out the format in which I should enter the solution so that essentially stopped me from playing the game properly.,
,,
Cute design (background),Difficult to understand how to use the tools (torch),nope
,,
Nice story telling,"A bit confusing with many props that cannot be used , and how to use is a bit ambiguous",
The game is really well planned and entertaing. It includes proper explanation and along with it good hints all across,just one thing after correct answer if the chatbot could reply with you are absolutel correct or something the game would have been perfect.,-
Nice background,,You should have a help option
,,
-,"1. The graphics of the background can be improved 
2. the game is not clear i was not bale to to understand the ques 1 even after trying for so long , I tried to move forward but it did not work.
3. No hints or clue can make the game very boring if one cannot move forward.",-
"I was well guided through the game, the commands worked intuitively and did what I intended for the most part. Everything made sense and was layed out in a way that made the tasks achievable. The text is clear and describes everything well.","Found the riddles to be maybe a little too easy; Some of the guidance was very accommodating (telling me what to do);  I was able to progress through a supposedly locked door; found no way to examine my surroundings after the initial description; I picked up some items, however, I never came to using them. Maybe something to do with the (un)locked door?","Rooms seem to be global, there seems to be no state that determines the room I am currently in. I don't know if this is intended but it might make sense to separate them, so the player can only look at the things in that room (and therefore target the correct table more easily for example), as well as look around again to get a list of things in the room, so they don't have to scroll up to find it."
"nice background, i like the crafting mechanic","the bot did not recognize my name, it was not understanding my answers to the riddle",
