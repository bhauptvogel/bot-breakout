scene_investigation:
  - base_1: "So, we are standing in the zombie-themed section of the ghost ride, next to our cabin. This place, you know, has a strangely romantic vibe but it also gives me a bit of a chill. Look at that spooky tree over there, completely devoid of leaves and the bench under it where the zombies are holding hands and gnawing on a ripped-off limb. \nWould you like to investigate one of those things?"
  - base_2: "Let´s have another close look at everything..."
  - base_3: "I think this is all we can find here."
  - weapon: "Let me see... the weapon is a knife. It’s a bit bloody and it’s a bit scary to hold it. Should I take a closer look or should we put it back where we found it?"
  - knife: "The Knife... Oh, there are initials on it. It says “A.P.”. Hm, who might it be?"
  - body: "Ok, it feels a bit scary to look at Maria's lifeless body, but perhaps we'll discover something that leads us to the murderer. Let’s take a few steps closer... She is covered in blood... sorry I'm feeling sick... I can't look at her anymore. Please say that we can look around now..."
  - cabin: "It has two seats, just like ours. On the seat closer to us is Maria. She is covered in blood and a note is pinned to her chest. I don’t see how she died... Should I investigate it more or should I tell you about the note..."
  - bench: "Just some zombie love dripping through the wooden slats of the bench. Or is this something else... Let's stand up but be careful to not get tangled in the zombies' limbs."
  - tree: "The tree is a bit scary. It’s a dead tree without leaves. Behind the tree, there is just some light equipment that adds to the spooky ambiance of the scene."
  - equipment: "I cannot see anything of interest here."
  - note: "There is a Note on the body. It says “You are next”. I believe it means that I am the target the murderer intends to go after next."
  - no_access: "It is inside the train cabin and we currently don't have access. We should first investigate the cabin..."

motive:
  Mika:
  - base_1: "No, I didn't have any issues with Maria and also I can't be the murderer since I was with you the whole time."
  Kira:
  - base_1: "Maria is the Ex of Kira. The break up wasn't so nice and a few days after, Maria was already together with Victor. Kira didn't handle the break up very well."
  - base_2: "You already asked me about Marias's motive but no worries, I'll tell you again. Maria is the Ex of Kira. The break up wasn't so nice and a few days after, Maria was already together with Victor. Kira didn't handle the break up very well."
  Patrick:
  - base_1: "I'm not sure if I should tell you about this, but whatever... the situation can't really get any worse. Maria had recently discovered that Patrick was involved in some illegal activities regarding corruption. I don't know the details but it would have been the end of Patrick's career if this story got published."
  - base_2: "You already asked me about Patrick's motive but no worries, I'll tell you again. Maria is the Ex of Kira. Maria had recently discovered that Patrick was involved in some illegal activities regarding corruption. I don't know the details but it would have been the end of Patrick's career if this story got published."
  Victor:
  - base_1: "As far as I know, he wouldn't have a reason to kill Maria. They just started dating and it was going really well."
  - base_2: "You already asked me about Victor's motive but no worries, I'll tell you again. Victor wouldn't have a reason to kill Maria. They just started dating and it was going really well."
  Anna:
  - base_1: "Anna and Maria were rivals. If it's about a good story Anna would have done anything. And they worked on the same story..."
  - base_2: "You already asked me about Anna's motive but no worries, I'll tell you again. She and Maria were rivals. If it's about a good story Anna would have done anything."
  Maria:
  - base_1: "I'm pretty sure Maria didn't unalive herself. This looks definitely like a murder."


access:
  Mika:
  - base_1: "Since I work here I do have access to the rollercoasters."
  Kira:
  - base_1: "Kira works at the rollercoaster and has backstage access, so yes, she had access."
  - base_2: "Like I told you: Kira works at the rollercoaster and she has backstage access, so indeed she had the necessary access."
  Patrick:
  - base_1: "Since he is the owner of the rollercoaster he definitely had access to it, so he could have done something..."
  - base_2: "Didn't you already ask me that? Well, since he's the owner of the rollercoaster, he definitely had access to it, which means he could have potentially done something..."
  Victor:
  - base_1: "Victor doesn't work at the rollercoaster, and since access to the backstage area requires specific keys, it's highly unlikely that he could have gotten back there."
  - base_2: "I think I told you. Victor isn't employed at the amusement park, and considering that access to the backstage area requires specific keys, it's highly improbable that he could have managed to get back there."
  Anna:
  - base_1: "Anna doesn't work here so she doesn't have the keys she requires to access backstage. So she couldn't get there"
  - base_2: "I think I told you, did I? Well, Anna doesn't actually work here, which means she doesn't have the necessary keys to access the backstage area. So, it was simply not possible for her to make her way there."
  Maria:
  - base_1: "Maria is the victim. She lies dead in the cabin."
  - base_2: "That is an odd question. Maria is the victim and lies dead in the cabin."
