scene_investigation:
  - base_1: "So, we are standing in the zombie-themed section of the ghost ride🧟, next to our cabin. This place has a strangely romantic vibe. We earlier shared a seat at the bench with two zombies holding hands and nibbling on limbs.🦴 In the background is a scary tree, devoid of leaves.🍂 <br>We could investigate the tree, the bench or the cabin with Marias dead body."
  - base_2: "Let´s have another close look at everything..."
  - base_3: "This is all we can find here. "
  - weapon: "Let me see... the weapon is a knife. It’s a bit bloody and it’s a bit scary to hold it. Oh, there are initials on it. It says “<em style='font-family: 'Brush Script MT', cursive;;'>A.P.</em>”. Hm, who might it be?👀 "

  - tree: "The tree is a bit scary. It’s a dead tree without leaves. Behind the tree, there is just some light equipment that adds to the spooky ambiance of the scene.🕸 Nothing to find here. <br> We are back next to the cabin again."
  - equipment: "The Green light reminds me of the hulk... 🐸  But there is nothing interesting to solve our mystery"
  - note: "The Note is pinned to the body. The murderer must be a psychopath... It says “<em style='font-family: Brush Script MT, cursive; color: red;'>You are next</em>”.
