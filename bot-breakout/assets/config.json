    "welcome-message": "After your long single life your best friend sets you up on a Date. With pounding hearts, you are excited to meet <b>Mika</b>. Mika works at an amusement park and has the whole place booked for the two of you! How generous! You both board the train cabin of the ghost train, feeling a sense of intimacy as your legs touch - AND THEN a sudden stop. In the dim light of the ghost ride, you see that a person in the cabin in front of you is slumped in their seat, dead with a note pinned to their chest, 'YOU ARE NEXT.' With adrenaline coursing through your veins, you must now unravel the mystery, find out who the killer is, and escape the ghost ride before it claims its next victim — you? Your date Mika is impatiently exiting the train cabin, out into the Zombieland of the ghost ride. Finding a dead body really is a bummer on a Date :/ But maybe you two get closer by solving this mystery. \nYou can always ask your date about a <b>hint</b>. Mika will give you an <b>overview</b> of the things you discovered so far. You two sit down on a bench together. Be kind, you should ask how Mika is doing!"
