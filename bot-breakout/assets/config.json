    "welcome-message": "<p>After your long single life your best friend sets you up on a Date with Mika. Mika works at an amusement park and had the whole place booked for the two of you! How generous!<br>You boarded the train cabin of the ghost train together - AND THEN a sudden stop. In the dim light of the ghost ride, you see that a woman in the cabin in front of you is slumped in their seat, she is dead! You must now unravel the mystery and find the killer before they claims their next victim â€” you? <br> Mika is impatiently exiting the train cabin, out into the Zombieland of the ghost ride. Finding a dead body seams to be a bummer on a Date :/ You can always ask Mika for a hint or help. Mika remembers the things you talked about and can give you an overview. <br> But first you two sit down on a bench together. Be kind, you should ask how Mika is doing!</p>"
