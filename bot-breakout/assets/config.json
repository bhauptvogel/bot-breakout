How generous! \uD83C\uDFA1 <br>You board the train cabin of the ghost train together and start the spooky ride - AND THEN a sudden stop. In the dim light of the ghost ride, you see that a woman in the cabin in front of you is slumped in her seat, she is dead! You must now unravel the mystery and find the killer before the next victim is claimed - you?\uD83E\uDE78 \uD83E\uDDB4 \uD83D\uDD2A <br> Mika is impatiently exiting the train cabin, out into the Zombieland of the ghost ride. Finding a dead body seams to be a bummer on a Date \uD83E\uDD7A You can always ask Mika for a <b>hint or help</b>. Mika remembers the things you talked about and can give you an overview. <br> But first you two sit down on a bench together. Be kind, you should ask how Mika is doing!
