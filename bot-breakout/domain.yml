  utter_who_is_mika:
  - text: As you already know, I work here at the amusement park. I'm part of the marketing team and we're currently working on a new marketing campaign, since we recently built a new large rollercoaster in our park and we hope to attract more people to come here.
  utter_you_cannot_leave:
  - text: You can’t leave before the police arrive in a few minutes! We need to find hints together, so they don’t think we two did it. Should we investigate or talk?
  - text: This is not possible! The murderer could still be walking around, we should wait until the police arrive in a few minutes. I think we should investigate the situation more.
