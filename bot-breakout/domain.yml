responses:
  utter_you_cannot_leave:
  - text: You canâ€™t leave before the police arrive in a few minutes! We need to find hints together, so they donâ€™t think we two did it. Should we investigate or talk?
  - text: This is not possible! The murderer could still be walking around, we should wait until the police arrive in a few minutes. I think we should investigate the situation more.
